Changes in version 1.11:

The "z" command has been fixed. ("zN" printed N + 1 lines). This bug was
present since at least ed-0.2.

The window size used by the "z" command has been documented in the
manual.

The targets "install-compress", "install-strip-compress",
"install-info-compress" and "install-man-compress" have been added to
the Makefile.
