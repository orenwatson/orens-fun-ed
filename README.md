# orens-fun-ed
I made some changes to the GNU ed editor  for fun. I added syntax highlighting and a change dirctory command.
The syntax highlighing is done by passing the output of p and n commands to an external program specified by -F switch or the F command. 
The change directory command is capital C, followed by the path to the directory.
